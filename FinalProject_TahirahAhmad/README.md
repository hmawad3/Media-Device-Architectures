Final Project for 2261, Media Devices Architecture. 

Use the arrow keys to move the bird around and shoot enemy birds incoming the other way. Occasionally, enemy birds will drop brief powerups when hit by a fireball. The further you get along in this game, the harder it will be to kill the enemy birds. Be sure to also avoid the sharp rocks on either side of the screen. You have 3 lives.

Must have a GBA emulator to run project. Build project in c.
