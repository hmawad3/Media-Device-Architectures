========================
BREAKOUT
By Tahirah Ahmad
========================

Game:
Breakout!
Once you hit start, the initial game screen will appear. Hit B
to get the ball moving (this is because the ball moves kinda fast
once it gets going)

Your objective is to bounce around the ball on your paddle and hit as
many bricks as you can. Once all the bricks have been knocked out, you've won.
Be sure not to let the ball go below your paddle, or you'll lose.

You only have one life.

------------------------

Controls:
Use the right and left arrow keys to move your paddle.
Hit start to get to the game screen, then hit B to begin playing
Hit Start to pause the game and to resume the game.
If you lost or won and would like to play again, hit start
