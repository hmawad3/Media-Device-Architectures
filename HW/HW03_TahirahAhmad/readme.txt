========================
BREAKOUT
By Tahirah Ahmad
========================

Game:
Breakout!
Once you hit start, the initial game screen will appear. Hit start
once more to begin playing (this is because the ball moves kinda fast
once it gets going)

Your objective is to bounce around the ball on your paddle and hit as
many bricks as you can. Once all the bricks have been knocked out, you've won.
Be sure not to let the ball go below your paddle, or you'll lose.

You only have one life and you can't pause the game.

------------------------

Controls:
Use the right and left arrow keys to move your paddle.
Hit start to get to the game screen, then hit start again to begin playing
